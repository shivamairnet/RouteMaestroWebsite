                        5.1. Algorithm.

            </br>5.2.2. RouteMaestro takes commercially reasonable measures to check the accuracy of the information and description of the Travel Services displayed on the Booking Services (including, without limitation, the pricing, photographs, list of hotel amenities, general product descriptions, etc.); however, RouteMaestro does not guarantee the accuracy or completeness of such information, as provided by Travel Providers.

                    </br>   7.2. Payment by Bank Transfer.

Both parties agree to apply any applicable tax treaty and provide the necessary documentation for application of such treaty, where applicable, to reduce the withholding tax. With respect to Taxes charged on or applicable to the purchase or sale of Travel Services, RouteMaestro shall reflect such Taxes in invoices and/or in the reporting available to Customer on the RouteMaestro Site, and Customer shall be responsible for the payment of all such Taxes.

        </br>       7.6. Late Payments.

                    </br>  11.2. Termination for Cause. If either party commits a material breach of its obligations in the Agreement or any Service Order (including payment obligations), the non-defaulting party may give written notice to the defaulting party specifying the nature of the default, and if such default is not remedied, or substantial efforts are not made to remedy such default, within thirty (30) days from the receipt of such notice, then the non-defaulting party shall have the right to immediately terminate the Agreement or the Service Order by written notice. If the breach relates solely to one Service Order or Service, then only that Service Order or Service may be terminated in accordance with the terms herein and the other Service Orders and the Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. In the event that Customer terminates in accordance with the Agreement, Customer shall be entitled to a pro-rated refund of unused, prepaid Fees as of the date of termination.
                      </br>  11.3. Termination for Insolvency. Notwithstanding anything set forth above, either party may terminate the Agreement immediately by providing written notice to the other party in the event the other party becomes insolvent, makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors, ceases to do business, or if any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency, liquidation proceeding, or other proceeding under any bankruptcy or other law for the relief of debtors is instituted by or against such party.
                      </br>  11.4. Rights and Obligations Upon Expiration or Termination. In no event shall any termination or expiration relieve Customer of the obligation to pay any undisputed Fees or Charges payable to RouteMaestro for the period prior to the effective date of termination or expiration. Provided RouteMaestro is not terminating for cause under Section 12.2 and upon Customer’s request, RouteMaestro will reasonably cooperate with Customer in a wind-down of Services prior to termination of a Service or of the Agreement. Customer shall be responsible for downloading any Customer Data and/or reporting available within the Services prior to the date of expiration or termination. Upon expiration or termination of the Agreement, (i) Customer’s and Users’ right to access and use the Services shall immediately terminate, (ii) Customer and its Users shall immediately cease all use of the Services, (iii) RouteMaestro shall cease use of the Customer Marks within a reasonable time, and (iv) each party shall delete or return, and make no further use of, any Confidential Information, materials, or other items (and all copies thereof) belonging to the other party, in accordance with Section 10.
                      </br>  11.5. Survival. Upon termination, any provision which, by its nature or express terms should survive, will survive, including, specifically, Sections 9 (Ownership), 10 (Confidentiality and Security), 13 (Indemnification), 14 (Limitation of Liability), 15 (Governing Law; Disputes), 16 (General).

                        12.1 Indemnification by Customer. Customer shall indemnify RouteMaestro & Airnet Travels, its Affiliates, officers, directors and employees, from and against any liabilities, losses, damages and expenses, including court costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees, associated with any claim by a third party (i) to the extent arising out of Customer’s or any User’s use of the Services in a manner that violates Sections 4.4, 4.5, or 4.6; (ii) alleging that any Customer Data, as used in the Services, violates a third party’s privacy rights (except to the extent such damages are caused by RouteMaestro’s failure to guard the privacy and security of Customer Data); (iii) arising out of Customer’s gross negligence, willful misconduct, or fraud; or (iv) arising out of Customer’s breach of a PSP Agreement, if applicable. Customer’s obligations under this Section 13.1 are contingent upon RouteMaestro providing Customer with prompt written notice of such claim. RouteMaestro may not settle any claim to which it is seeking or is entitled to indemnification in a manner that would result in an admission of any wrongdoing by Customer, without Customer’s prior written approval.
                       </br> 12.2 Indemnification by RouteMaestro. RouteMaestro shall indemnify Customer, its officers, directors and employees, from and against any liabilities, losses, damages and expenses, including court costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees, associated with any third party’s claim that (i) the Services or Customer’s authorized use of Services infringes or misappropriate the Intellectual Property Rights of any third party; (ii) arises out of RouteMaestro’s gross negligence, willful misconduct, or fraud; or (iii) arises out of RouteMaestro’s breach of its agreements with a PSP, if applicable. RouteMaestro’s obligations under this Section 13.2 are contingent upon (a) Customer providing RouteMaestro with prompt written notice of such claim; (b) Customer providing reasonable cooperation to RouteMaestro, at RouteMaestro’s expense, in the defense and settlement of such claim; and (c) with respect to a claim described in Section 13.2(i) above, RouteMaestro having sole authority to defend or settle such claim. RouteMaestro shall have no liability under this Section 13.2 to the extent that any claims described herein are based on use of the Services in a manner that violates: (1) the Agreement; or (2) instructions provided to Customer by RouteMaestro, so long as they are reasonable and consistent with the terms of the Agreement.
                        </br> 12.3 Infringement Claim Remedies. With respect to claims described in subsection 13.2(i), in the event that RouteMaestro’s right to provide the Services is enjoined or in RouteMaestro’s reasonable opinion is likely to be enjoined, RouteMaestro may obtain the right to continue providing the Services, replace or modify the Services so that they become non-infringing, or, if such remedies are not reasonably available, terminate the Agreement without liability to Customer and provide a pro rata refund of any Fees prepaid and unused upon such termination. Sections 13.2 and 13.3 state the entire obligation of RouteMaestro and its licensors with respect to any alleged or actual infringement or misappropriation of third-party Intellectual Property Rights by the Services.

                        13.1 Consequential Damages Waiver. In no event shall either party be liable to the other party for any incidental, special, exemplary or consequential damages, including loss of income, data, profits, revenue or business interruption, or cost of substitute services, or other economic loss, whether or not such party has been advised of the possibility of such damages, and whether any claim for recovery is based on theories of contract, warranty, tort (including negligence and strict liability) or otherwise.
                        13.2 Limitation of Liability. Except for (i) Customer’s obligation to pay Fees and Charges, and (ii) as provided in Section 14.3, each party’s aggregate liability to the other party in connection with the Agreement shall not exceed the total Fees paid or payable by Customer in the twelve-month period preceding the claim or action, regardless of the form or theory of the claim or action. If the Agreement has been in effect for less than 12 months, the actual total Fees paid or payable shall be annualized.
    </br>               13.3 Exceptions.

        14.1 Governing Law. The Agreement and all matters arising out of or relating to the Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Punjab, India without regard to its conflict of law provisions.
    </br>14.2 Informal Resolution. Before filing a claim, each party agrees to try to resolve the dispute by contacting the other party through reasonable means and providing notice of the dispute. Both parties will use good faith efforts to attempt to reach a resolution. If a dispute is not resolved within thirty (30) days of notice, either party may bring a formal proceeding.
</br>14.3 Agreement to Arbitrate. RouteMaster and Customer agree to resolve any claims relating to the Agreement through final and binding arbitration, except as set forth below. The Courts Of Ludhiana will administer the arbitration under its Commercial Arbitration Rules. The arbitration will be held in Ludhiana, Punjab.
</br>14.4 Equitable Relief. Each party acknowledges that a breach by the other party of any confidentiality or Intellectual Property Rights provisions of the Agreement may cause the non-breaching party irreparable damage, for which the award of damages would not be adequate compensation. Consequently, the non-breaching party may institute an action to enjoin the breaching party from any and all acts in violation of those provisions, which remedy shall be cumulative and not exclusive, and a party may seek the entry of an injunction enjoining any breach or threatened breach of those provisions, in addition to any other relief to which the non-breaching party may be entitled at law or in equity.

Notices provided to RouteMaestro will be sent to legal@RouteMaestro.com.
